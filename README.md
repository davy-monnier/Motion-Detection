Motion and light intensity detection, is a group school project that aims to introduce students to the IOT domain by developing a small connected device to internet in order to fulfill a daily need. The device that we will build, is composed of a motion detector, and a light sensor that can be used for domestic, or commercial ends. Our project is made available to anyone who wants to try it and build himself.
