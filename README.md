# Motion-AND-Light-Intensity-Detection

## The Project and goals :

Motion and light intensity detection, is a group school project that aims to introduce students to the IOT domain by developing a small connected device to internet in order to fulfill a daily need. The device that we will build, is composed of a motion detector, and a light sensor that can be used for domestic, or commercial ends. Our project is made available to anyone who wants to try it and build himself.

## Organisation :

Initially the project need to be done in group of 2 to 4 people. As our group was composed of 4 members, for more productivity and efficiency, we decided to split the workload into two subgroups. the first subgroup was in charge of the hardware part (connecting the wemos, plugging and configuration of the sensors, writing the arduino code... )
And the second group was responsible of the web front development and connecting the device to the cloud for collecting and displaying the sensors metrics in real time.
